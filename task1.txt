make a shopmenu.html file that looks approximately like shopmenu.pdf 

there's limited time, so make it simple and quick. it does not need to
look exactly like the example:

- use CSS for some style elements
- use JavaScript so that whenever you click on "order" for a product,
  it should display a message "Error: <product> is sold out" 
  Whenever you enter an email address and click on "subscribe", it
  should display an error message "Error: <email address> is not valid"
